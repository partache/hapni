# Monorepo for App called "Hapni" blog system with Express (TypeScript) Backend and Angular Frontend

This monorepo contains an Express backend and an Angular frontend. It leverages TypeScript for both the backend and frontend development. The backend uses nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

## Project Structure

The monorepo is organized as follows:
- `api/`: Express backend application written in TypeScript.
- `frontend/`: Angular frontend application written in TypeScript.
- `api/package.json`: package.json managing dependencies and scripts for the express app.
- `api/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file for the express app.
- `frontend/package.json`: package.json managing dependencies and scripts for the express app.
